  is a service that helps folks who want to share rides contact each other &amp; mutually arrange for traveling together. Travelers looking for a ride can post a request and search for folks who can offer them a ride. Folks who want to share their vehicle can similarly post an offer and connect with people who are looking for a ride. I think you might find it useful.
